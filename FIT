1. Fit a Model
In the following examples lower case letters are numeric variables and upper case letters are factors.

# One Way Anova (Completely Randomized Design)
fit <- aov(y ~ A, data=mydataframe)

# Randomized Block Design (B is the blocking factor) 
fit <- aov(y ~ A + B, data=mydataframe)

# Two Way Factorial Design 
fit <- aov(y ~ A + B + A:B, data=mydataframe)
fit <- aov(y ~ A*B, data=mydataframe) # same thing

# Analysis of Covariance 
fit <- aov(y ~ A + x, data=mydataframe)

For within subjects designs, the data frame has to be rearranged so that each measurement on a subject is a separate observation. See R and Analysis of Variance.

# One Within Factor
fit <- aov(y~A+Error(Subject/A),data=mydataframe)

# Two Within Factors W1 W2, Two Between Factors B1 B2 
fit <- aov(y~(W1*W2*B1*B2)+Error(Subject/(W1*W2))+(B1*B2),
  	data=mydataframe)
    
summary(fit) # display Type I ANOVA table
drop1(fit,~.,test="F") # type III SS and F Tests

# Tukey Honestly Significant Differences
TukeyHSD(fit) # where fit comes from aov()

Power analysis is an important aspect of experimental design. It allows us to determine the sample size required to detect an effect of a given size with a given degree of confidence. Conversely, it allows us to determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence, under sample size constraints. If the probability is unacceptably low, we would be wise to alter or abandon the experiment.

# For a one-way ANOVA comparing 5 groups, calculate the
# sample size needed in each group to obtain a power of
# 0.80, when the effect size is moderate (0.25) and a
# significance level of 0.05 is employed.

pwr.anova.test(k=5,f=.25,sig.level=.05,power=.8)

# What is the power of a one-tailed t-test, with a
# significance level of 0.01, 25 people in each group, 
# and an effect size equal to 0.75?

pwr.t.test(n=25,d=0.75,sig.level=.01,alternative="greater")

# Using a two-tailed test proportions, and assuming a
# significance level of 0.01 and a common sample size of 
# 30 for each proportion, what effect size can be detected 
# with a power of .75? 

pwr.2p.test(n=30,sig.level=0.01,power=0.75)

# various sizes.
