Thus our correlation coefficient is 1. This means that the data = ”fully” linearly correlated, or that there is a function y = ax + b that translated the x data into the y data.

x<-c(77,65,73,58,63,49,51,82,103,69)

Obs.:We reject the null hypothesis for too small values of T. Then, P(T(23) ≤ tα; H0) =
P(T(23) ≥ −tα; H0) = 0.10. By looking in the table we find −tα = 1.32, thus tα = −1.32.
Our t-value is not smaller than tα, we cannot reject the null hypothesis. Therefore we cannot
prove that people of age 40 are on average heavier than people of age 30.

We reject our null hypothesis for too small values of T. Then, P(T(7) ≤ tα; H0) = P(T(7) ≥
−tα) = 0.05. By looking in the table we find −tα = 1.89, so tα = −1.89. Since our t-value
is not smaller than tα we cannot reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we cannot prove that
the marketing strategy actually worked.
